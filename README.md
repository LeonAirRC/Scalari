## Why use Scalari?
Model makers often find themselves with nothing more than an image of the model.
That's all you need, because with Scalari you can:
- produce true-scale prints of an image
- measure lengths, angles and proportions
- display the image in true-scale to trace shapes and check layouts and designs
- draw lines as reference or assist markings

## How it works
Every project starts with the selection of an image. After that it can be configured by placing two nodes that correspond to a segment with a known length.
Then you can either insert the desired scale or the desired length of the defined segment for the model.

## Tutorial
Don't worry if this sounds complicated, the built-in tutorial introduces all features and gives detailed explanations.

#### Additional features
- image export (optionally including all grahpical elements)
- built-in tutorial
- tabbed layout for parallel productivity
- bug report
- DPI calculator
- customizable interface
